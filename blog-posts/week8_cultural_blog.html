        <h1>WEEK EIGHT</h1>
        <h2>Conflicts</h2>
        <span>09/28/2014</span>
        <p>The last time I was in emotional conflict , it  was 2 years ago ,when I first started my job. The guy sitting behind me was all the time sighing. I told him once if he be carefull with sighing, but it did not help.</p>
        <p>I handled the conflict by withdrawal. I changed my seat. And that solde the problem.</p>
        <p>I think my actions made it better.</p>
        <p>If you could go back,I would not do anything differently.</p>
        <p>I think withdrawal works most of the time.</p>
