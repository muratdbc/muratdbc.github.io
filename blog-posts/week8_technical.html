        <h1>WEEK EIGHT</h1>
        <h2>How internet works</h2>
        <span>09/28/2014</span>
        <p>The internet is a world-wide network of computers linked together by telephone wires, satellite links and other means. For simplicity's sake we will say that all computers on the internet can be divided into two categories: <em>server</em>s
        and <em>browser</em>s.
        </p>
        <p> Servers  are specialised computers which store information, share information with other servers, and make this information available to the general public.
        </p>
        <p>Browsers are what people use to access the World Wide Web from any standard computer.</p>
        <p>When you connect your computer to the internet, you are connecting to a special type of server which is provided and operated by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). The job of this "ISP Server" is to provide the link between your browser and the rest of the internet.</p>
        <p>All the computers on the net that are connected should have a unique address. This unique address is called IP address. In order one computer talk to another one they have to know each others IP address. Aside from that all the text on computer needs to be translated to to zeros and ones. That is done by the protocal stack.
