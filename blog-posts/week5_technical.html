        <h2>RUBY CLASSES</h2>
        <span>09/05/2014</span>
        <p>What are classes? A class is blueprint of an object. Let me give you an example.Let's say
          you want to make a cookie and you have a cookie cutter for job. You want to have your cookies
          different color and with different ingredients.From this eample we can deduce that  Cookie cutter
          is a class and all the cookies that you made out of that cookie cutter are objects. Defining a
          class lets you group behaviours into convenient bundles, so you can quikcly create many objects
          behave essentially the same way.
        </p>
        <p> Let'say you have a cookie class and in that cookie class  you want to set and get the color,
          calory and shape of the cookie. Below is the Ruby class for creating cookie objet. As you can
          see there are six instance methods(set_color,color,set_shape,shape,set_calory and calory) and
          three(@shape,@color and @calory) instance variables which helps the creation of objects along
          with methods.</p>
        <section ><img src="..\images\CookieClassRuby.png"></section>
        <p > You can create a new cookie object by instantiating Cookie class.As soon as you instiate the new object you can start using the instance variables and methods. Keep in mind that instance variables and methods only  live on the object that is being created. Class methods and class variables live on the class level, so if you want to use those class level methods and variables
        you should not instantiate object from cookie, you should use the class to use those. </p>
