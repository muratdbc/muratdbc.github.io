        <h1>WEEK THREE</h1>
        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <span>08/24/2014</span>
        <p>It all started with static web pages. People are tired of seeing dull HTML. They wanted to see more of interaction between the user and web page. At that point,Javascript emerges as the new kid on the block. It was doing what is necessay; lightwieght , lives in the browser and lots of interaction. Developers loved it so much since it enables a lot of interaction with the user.
        </p>
        <p>Javascript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser.Javascript  is easy to learn, is fast compared to the other languages and since it is interpreted language there is no need to compile. Javascript has a very powerful object literal notation. I think this object notation is inspiration of JSON, the popular data exhange format. </p>
        <p>One of the limitation of the Javascript is Gloabl Variables. Global variable is a varaibel that is visible in every scope. Haveing lots of them in larger projects can become problematic. Another limitation or difference from other languages , since Javascript's scope is function based, most programmers are more familiar with the block based scope , this can be very surprising to programmers with experience  in other languages. The last limitation is eveything that is input through the browser is String.</p>
