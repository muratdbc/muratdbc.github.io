        <h1>WEEK THREE</h1>
        <h2>LEARNING AND THINKING STYLE</h2>
        <span>08/24/2014</span>
        <p>
        Learning and thinking styles are the most untouched parts in my DBC journey. I know how I learn,but could not put into words. Articles help me understand how my thinking and learning style is and every time I read my thinking style , I can pinpoint the areas that I could not understand while studying. I think one of the buggest struggle is when I dont have a structed env. (such as to do list or checklist), I am really having though time to  prioritize my time and energy. So from now on ,before I start that weeks challenge , I read all the challenges and make a checklist for myself what are the dues for this week.
        </p>
        <p>Another problematic area is finding the answer with trial and error approach, it is good tat you do not forget after you find out with trial-error approach but I have to spend a lot of time to find the rigth answer. I  thinks the root cause of the trial-error approach is stemming from not knowing the material good enough, so you start making guesses based on what you know. My action plan from now will be understanding the material before attempting to do challenges.</p>
