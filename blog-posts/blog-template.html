        <h2>Web Sites that I enjoy</h2>
        <span>08/10/2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://wwww.tangomango.org">Tango Mango</a>This is best community, non-profit webiste out there for tango lovers. This webiste caters 4 different major areas of US: San Francisco, Chicago, LA
        New York and Florida. You can find lessons, practicas and milongas(fast style Tango) dances and save to your calendar. Not only it does serve tango lovers, but also it serves to tango teachers and organizers who would like to reach out to broader audience. The best part about this site is that it is completely free. I would like to do Native application of this websites as a final project during my DBC, if I can find boots that will help me out along the way.
        </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.zite.com/">Zite</a>Although this is not really website on the web, it is very good app for IOS and Android. App works like(IMHO) this, it harvest every blog and twitter feeds out there ,store them in DB and then categorize them by meta data and then serves as one feed to their user.
        The good thing is you can search for topic and save that as your favorite stream , so next time you open the app, you will be able to see all the stories about that specific topic. This app is also free.

        <p><a href="http://www.minted.com">Minted</a>I love this site not only I used to work there but the cause is great. Here is what they do in their own words "Minted crowd-sources design and art from a global community of independent designers, then sells their best designs as fine products such as stationery, wall art, and d√©cor for the home, holidays, and occasions. Minted was an early pioneer of crowdsourcing product design and has held open art and graphic design challenges monthly since 2008.All designers and artists are welcome to enter our open challenges. Designers collaborate on our community platform and provide peer critiques that improve both designers and designs over time. Consumers and designers curate Minted's product assortment by voting on the entries to each challenge, ensuring that the best designers and designs are surfaced and represented on Minted. Minted produces and sells the winning designs, paying the designer a commission on every sale."
        This might not make sense at first . but when you think about developing countries, those commission means a lot of money in those countries, So that is why I love this site very much.
