        <h2>PAIRING AND FEEDBACK</h2>
        <span>09/05/2014</span>
        <p>I think pairing in DBC phase 0 is extremely helpful since you dont understand the whole material, you want to find somebody like yourself so you can talk the same language. I think couple things to look out for before pairing; how well your partner is perpared, how much knowledge she/he had before about Ruby,JS,HTML. If you and your partner are ont he same level,
        it can be rewarding and fun, otherwise it might lead to something else.
        </p>
        <p>When I felt my first feedback, it was very humbling and felt very good. I think most of the
         feedbacks that I gotten was really specific and actionable,so I took the necessary actions:such as not to fly through the material and express myself more clearly.But the thing that I dont understand is those feedback on the socrates
         can be easily told to your partner "So and so  I did not understand what you had said can you repeat one more time" or "
         Hey partner i think you are flying through the material , do you mind slowing down so I can understand ". I don't think any partner  will be offended by hearing those two sentenc,at least I don't.</p>
        <p>Writing feedback is great way of expressing how the pairing went. When I write feedback I feel sheer joy of the completing the work with my partner. Most of the time it is relatively easy to write the pair review, as everybody would agree, it is very hard to write negative feedback about someone. So far , I think I learnt a lot from the feedback that I got from my pairs and I am working really hard on those.</p>
