        <h1>WEEK SIX</h1>
        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <span>09/13/2014</span>
        <p>I think eveyone at some point in their life exprienced stereotype threat. I once felt it when I was in elementary school, I was always getting low grades from science related classes and even-though I work long hours it was affecting my grades so much.
        Hopefully  I had dad on my side and he told me that "I am not different than anybody and even I would not get high grades, he still loves me no matter what". </p>
        <p>After hearing those two sentence from my dad, it made my self-confidence level go up and afterwards I always got high grades. If I ever face the same problems , I always remember those two sentences that my dad told me. When I go deep in those two sentence , there is one fundemental lesson. That is to tell your brain to stop telling you that you are not good enough.   </p>
