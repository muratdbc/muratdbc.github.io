        <h1>WEEK FIVE</h1>
        <h2>PAIRING AND FEEDBACK</h2>
        <span>09/05/2014</span>
        <p>I think pairing in DBC phase 0 is extremely helpful since you dont understand the whole material, you want to find somebody like yourself so you can talk the same language. I think couple things to look out for before pairing; how well your partner is perpared, how much knowledge she/he had before about Ruby,JS,HTML. If you and your partner are ont he same level,
        it can be rewarding and fun, otherwise it might lead to something else.
        </p>
        <p>When I felt my first feedback, it was very humbling and felt very good. I think most of the
         feedbacks that I gotten was really specific and actionable,so I took the necessary actions:such as not to fly through the material and express myself more clearly.But the thing that I dont understand is those feedback on the socrates
         can be easily told to your partner "So and so  I did not understand what you had said can you repeat one more time" or "
         Hey partner i think you are flying through the material , do you mind slowing down so I can understand ". I don't think any partner  will be offended by hearing those two sentenc,at least I don't.</p>
        <p>Writing feedback is great way of expressing how the pairing went. When I write feedback I feel sheer joy of the completing the work with my partner. Most of the time it is relatively easy to write the pair review, as everybody would agree, it is very hard to write negative feedback about someone. So far , I think I learnt a lot from the feedback that I got from my pairs and I am working really hard on those.</p>

        <h2>RUBY CLASSES</h2>
        <span>09/05/2014</span>
        <p>What are classes? A class is blueprint of an object. Let me give you an example.Let's say
          you want to make a cookie and you have a cookie cutter for job. You want to have your cookies
          different color and with different ingredients.From this eample we can deduce that  Cookie cutter
          is a class and all the cookies that you made out of that cookie cutter are objects. Defining a
          class lets you group behaviours into convenient bundles, so you can quikcly create many objects
          behave essentially the same way.
        </p>
        <p> Let'say you have a cookie class and in that cookie class  you want to set and get the color,
          calory and shape of the cookie. Below is the Ruby class for creating cookie objet. As you can
          see there are six instance methods(set_color,color,set_shape,shape,set_calory and calory) and
          three(@shape,@color and @calory) instance variables which helps the creation of objects along
          with methods.</p>
        <section ><img src="..\images\CookieClassRuby.png"></section>
        <p > You can create a new cookie object by instantiating Cookie class.As soon as you instiate the new object you can start using the instance variables and methods. Keep in mind that instance variables and methods only  live on the object that is being created. Class methods and class variables live on the class level, so if you want to use those class level methods and variables
        you should not instantiate object from cookie, you should use the class to use those. </p>

        <h2>Solving America's Talent Gap</h2>
        <span>08/31/2014</span>
        <p> USA is not producing enough scientist and technologist that other countries are. But the real question to ask ourselves is "how are we going to keep America's long-term comptetive advantage.".  We always hear that all the job are being out-sourced and America is falling behind China and other countires in terms of innovation. I dont think that those are founded. Here is why
        </p>
        <p>
        Today there are more tech related jobs than there are qualified US candidates. Compared to China or other countries, we are filling only half of the jobs that requires a comptuer science degree.Since U.S. jobs business thriving , we have to find the right people , that is the reason that H1-B visa are for. It allows hiring qualified candidates in specalized jobs for limited periods of time. The key is limited periods of time, they are not stealing our jobs. America have a talent GAP, unless we found a long-term solution ,  I think it is in our best interset to get grant those visa,so we can keep those innovators . By keeping innovators here , we will keep the innovation here. Otherwise we will see that all those innovator along with intellectual property and revenue it generates goes to other countries.

        <h2>Ruby Enumerable Map</h2>
        <span>08/31/2014</span>
        <p>This post will dive into one the most used built-in method that you get when you include Ruby's most useful Module :Enumerable.  What is Module? Module contains bunch of methods packaged together and get added (proper term is mixed-in) to classes such as Hash and Arrays.
        </p>
        <p>Enumerables module comes with really useful method.like #map,so my main goal is to get well acquinted with it. In Ruby doc definition, this is what map does: Returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum.</p>
        <p>Map in essence iterates over the elements of the array and every element will be applied what is defined in the block part. The block part  can be any code kind of code. Of course If you use only #map method the actual array will not be changed. In order to change the actual array, you have to use destructive one which is #map! </p>

        <h1>WEEK THREE</h1>
        <h2>LEARNING AND THINKING STYLE</h2>
        <span>08/24/2014</span>
        <p>
        Learning and thinking styles are the most untouched parts in my DBC journey. I know how I learn,but could not put into words. Articles help me understand how my thinking and learning style is and every time I read my thinking style , I can pinpoint the areas that I could not understand while studying. I think one of the buggest struggle is when I dont have a structed env. (such as to do list or checklist), I am really having though time to  prioritize my time and energy. So from now on ,before I start that weeks challenge , I read all the challenges and make a checklist for myself what are the dues for this week.
        </p>
        <p>Another problematic area is finding the answer with trial and error approach, it is good tat you do not forget after you find out with trial-error approach but I have to spend a lot of time to find the rigth answer. I  thinks the root cause of the trial-error approach is stemming from not knowing the material good enough, so you start making guesses based on what you know. My action plan from now will be understanding the material before attempting to do challenges.</p>

        <h1>WEEK THREE</h1>
        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <span>08/24/2014</span>
        <p>It all started with static web pages. People are tired of seeing dull HTML. They wanted to see more of interaction between the user and web page. At that point,Javascript emerges as the new kid on the block. It was doing what is necessay; lightwieght , lives in the browser and lots of interaction. Developers loved it so much since it enables a lot of interaction with the user.
        </p>
        <p>Javascript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser.Javascript  is easy to learn, is fast compared to the other languages and since it is interpreted language there is no need to compile. Javascript has a very powerful object literal notation. I think this object notation is inspiration of JSON, the popular data exhange format. </p>
        <p>One of the limitation of the Javascript is Gloabl Variables. Global variable is a varaibel that is visible in every scope. Haveing lots of them in larger projects can become problematic. Another limitation or difference from other languages , since Javascript's scope is function based, most programmers are more familiar with the block based scope , this can be very surprising to programmers with experience  in other languages. The last limitation is eveything that is input through the browser is String.</p>

        <h2>Margin,Padding and Border</h2>
        <span>08/15/2014</span>
        <p>Today I will talk about margins, padding and borders. But before we dive into I would like to mention about the box model.ok but lets start with basics. HTML is a markup language for describing the strcuture of web  pages. HTML is a tree-like structure where each node can be called as element. Cascade Style Sheets(CSS) contols the presentation of the the web page. So to speak, CSS controls how HTML element is represented.CSS treates every element as if it were represented by a box. Below is  the image of a box model.</p>
        <div id="box-model1"><img src="../images/box.png" alt="Box"></div>
        <p>As you can see every element has a content, which could be a text or image and this content is placed inside a box that is just big enough to contain it. Notice that content area has not white space.Padding is used to create visual space whitespace between the content and the border of the box. Padding is transparent and has no color or decoration of its own. Border surrounds the padding and, becasue it takes the form of a line around your content,provides visual seperation between your content and other elements oon page.Margin gives a way to add space between your element and other spaces. Below is the  CSSdeck console and you can get the idea behind the padding,margin and border by changing the CSS.If you cant see the console, you might want to check <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/487748/how-to-allow-chrome-browser-to-load-insecure-content">this link</a> </p>

        <h2>Welcome to my kitchen</h2>
        <span>08/10/2014</span>
        <p>Oh wow what a start! what a week!.. </p>
        <p>So far I liked it.I liked it because I think the word "vulnerable" makes this journey interesting.
        I think eveybody will check their ego outside the DBC, where we will have a truly amazing lerning experience through Pair Programming and long hours of coding. Does it make nervous to be vulnerable ?
        Of course it does, but I  know that if I would like to learn, I have to get used to the idea "being vulnerable".
        </p>
        <p>Apart from those, everyone I talked to or interacted with  are very friendly and wants to you to be
        successful. As an outsider rigth now, DBC culture seems like  very team oriented,fast and super collaboretive just as the other startups in the valley. I think I will be good fit for DBC since my motto for learning is "teaching is the best learning style".
        </p>
        <p>
        To be honest , so far DBC exceeded my expectations. Not only they will teach me how to code , but also will give me a new perspective how to see the world from  different angle. I am hoping/believing that
        after graduating the DBC, I will have lot of people on my side that I can ask for advice and call true friends.
