        <h1>WEEK TWO</h1>
        <h2>Margin,Padding and Border</h2>
        <span>08/15/2014</span>
        <p>Today I will talk about margins, padding and borders. But before we dive into I would like to mention about the box model.ok but lets start with basics. HTML is a markup language for describing the strcuture of web  pages. HTML is a tree-like structure where each node can be called as element. Cascade Style Sheets(CSS) contols the presentation of the the web page. So to speak, CSS controls how HTML element is represented.CSS treates every element as if it were represented by a box. Below are  the images of a box model.</p>
        <div id="box-model1"><img src="../images/box.png" alt="Box"></div>
        <p>As you can see every element has a content, which could be a text or image and this content is placed inside a box that is just big enough to contain it. Notice that content area has not white space.Padding is used to create visual space whitespace between the content and the border of the box. Padding is transparent and has no color or decoration of its own. Border surrounds the padding and, becasue it takes the form of a line around your content,provides visual seperation between your content and other elements oon page.Margin gives a way to add space between your element and other spaces. Below I embed CSSdeck script that you can play with and can get the idea behind the padding,margin and border.  </p>

The best part about this site is that it is all in one place , well organized, easy to use and very intuitive.Aside from that you can see all the events that you want to go in one page, after you sign in.

        <p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>This is the early adopters of MOOC sites. Landing page of Coursera is very intuitive and user friendly.

        <h1>WEEK ONE</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my kitchen</h2>
        <span>08/10/2014</span>
        <p>Oh wow what a start! what a week!.. </p>
        <p>So far I liked it.I liked it because I think the word "vulnerable" makes this journey interesting.
        I think eveybody will check their ego outside the DBC, where we will have a truly amazing lerning experience through Pair Programming and long hours of coding. Does it make nervous to be vulnerable ?
        Of course it does, but I  know that if I would like to learn, I have to get used to the idea "being vulnerable".
        </p>
        <p>Apart from those, everyone I talked to or interacted with  are very friendly and wants to you to be
        successful. As an outsider rigth now, DBC culture seems like  very team oriented,fast and super collaboretive just as the other startups in the valley. I think I will be good fit for DBC since my motto for learning is "teaching is the best learning style".
        </p>
        <p>
        To be honest , so far DBC exceeded my expectations. Not only they will teach me how to code , but also will give me a new perspective how to see the world from  different angle. I am hoping/believing that
        after graduating the DBC, I will have lot of people on my side that I can ask for advice and call true friends.
