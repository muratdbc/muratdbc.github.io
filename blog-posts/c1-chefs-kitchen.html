        <span>08/10/2014</span>
        <p>Oh wow what a start! what a week!.. </p>
        <p>So far I liked it.I liked it because I think the word "vulnerable" makes this journey interesting.
        I think eveybody will check their ego outside the DBC, where we will have a truly amazing lerning experience through Pair Programming and long hours of coding. Does it make nervous to be vulnerable ?
        Of course it does, but I  know that if I would like to learn, I have to get used to the idea "being vulnerable".
        </p>
        <p>Apart from those, everyone I talked to or interacted with  are very friendly and wants to you to be
        successful. As an outsider rigth now, DBC culture seems like  very team oriented,fast and super collaboretive just as the other startups in the valley. I think I will be good fit for DBC since my motto for learning is "teaching is the best learning style".
        </p>
        <p>
        To be honest , so far DBC exceeded my expectations. Not only they will teach me how to code , but also will give me a new perspective how to see the world from  different angle. I am hoping/believing that
        after graduating the DBC, I will have lot of people on my side that I can ask for advice and call true friends.
