        <h2>Solving America's Talent Gap</h2>
        <span>08/31ÃŸ/2014</span>
        <p> USA is not producing enough scientist and technologist that other countries are. But the real question to ask ourselves is "how are we going to keep America's long-term comptetive advantage.".  We always hear that all the job are being out-sourced and America is falling behind China and other countires in terms of innovation. I dont think that those are founded. Here is why
        </p>
        <p>
        Today there are more tech related jobs than there are qualified US candidates. Compared to China or other countries, we are filling only half of the jobs that requires a comptuer science degree.Since U.S. jobs business thriving , we have to find the right people , that is the reason that H1-B visa are for. It allows hiring qualified candidates in specalized jobs for limited periods of time. The key is limited periods of time, they are not stealing our jobs. America have a talent GAP, unless we found a long-term solution ,  I think it is in our best interset to get grant those visa,so we can keep those innovators . By keeping innovators here , we will keep the innovation here. Otherwise we will see that all those innovator along with intellectual property and revenue it generates goes to other countries.
