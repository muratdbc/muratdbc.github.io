        <h1>WEEK NINE</h1>
        <h2>Asking Questions</h2>
        <span>10/03/2014</span>
        <p>I usually do not ask questions on the blog posts, since I know that the questions that I am going to ask had been answered fully or partailly, so the first thing I do is google the question.</p>
        <p>After looking some of the questions that I asked I realized that I have to be more clear and consice with my questions.
          I have to make sure that from the title ,reader should be able to understand most of the problem that I am facing.
          Also if I give code examples ,and the output that I would like to see after the program run.Also it will be more helpful if
          I can link the code into websites such as jsfiddle,codepen etc..., so they can easliy run the code and provide real time  debubbing.</p>
          <p>If you dont ask questions , you wont get answers.Finally done with writing :)</p>
