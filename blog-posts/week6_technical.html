        <h2>Inheritance vs Compisition</h2>
        <span>09/13/2014</span>
        <p>The question youask to yourself while writing any piece of code read after this blog post should be "Is-a"  or "has-a". Right now the first sentence is not making any sense ,but let's continue.</p>
        <p>Writing successful software starts with succint and understandable classes. You dont want to repeat yourself, this can be achieved by defining some kind of a relationship between classes. I will say it is relationship , but you can also paraphrase it  "mechanism for code reuse"</p>
        <p>Inheritance in it's simplest terms "object ability to inherit characteristics from another object".Inheritance allows us to encompass the parent class' state and behaviors into its child. The child class can then extend the state and behaviors to reflect the differences it represents. A good example is between human and man classes,let'say man class inherited from Human class. By above definition man class inherited all the state and behaviour from Human class. The understand if you are inheriting from the right class, you should ask this question. "Is man(subclass) a human(parent class)" , then your inheritance thought is right, otherwise you should look compisition.</p>
        <p>Compsition is a way to combine simple objects or data types into more complex ones. As the name implies, you are mixing other objects to make another complex object. Think about the chair example. A chair has a Seat. A chair has a back. And a chair has a set of legs. The phrase "has a" implies a relationship where the chair owns, or at minimum, uses, another object. It is this "has a" relationship which is the basis for composition.</p>
        <p>As you see above, if you want to define the relationshipds between your classes, you should ask above two questions when you are writing your code."Is-a"  or "has-a" </p>
