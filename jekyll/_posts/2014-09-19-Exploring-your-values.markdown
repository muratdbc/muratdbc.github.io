 When I think of my happiest and proudest moments in my life, the two values come to my mind is persistance and perseverance. I think nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins — not through strength, but through persistence.

Persistance, perserverance ,commitment and spirituality are the most important ones for me. I think when you look at the all those values, you can see that all of them are tied together.if you know your inner spirituality, then you will have right commitments and once you have the right commitment, you will set the right goals for yourself and by persistance and perseverance, you will achieve those goals.

It all starts with yourself. Once you have knowledge about yourself such as your weakness and strengths , you can sideline your first and biggest enemy:self. After that you have to think with the right mind what will be your commitments just as setting your goals. This is the part where you can get help from others that will see your from different perspective than yourself.

Once you establish your goals, the second step is to make sure that you will perservere and persist in your journey.No matter what you will try stay positive and start accomplishing your goals with the same enthusiasm every day. No matter what happened yesterday is the by-gone and let the by-gone be by-gone.

I try to not give advice since I do not like giving advices.

When I feel that I am failing in something, I will go back to my spirituality and try to find out what I had done wrong and what I should do next to make sure that I will not do the same faliure again.
