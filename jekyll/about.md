After spending 10 years flying with Helicopters as an Air Force Officer, I thought that every person should change
their job every 15 years. Why 15 years ?  Mastering something takes 10,000 hours, which roughly
corresponds to 15 years.

In 2007, I thought that my swithcing careers time has come and started my masters degree. Finishing my masters degree
I worked as QA Automation Engineer for 6 years. In late 2014 I started DevBootCamp to be a developer. Hopefully in
2015 , I will get job as a developer.

My next job? Oh yes, I would like to switch careers again in 2020, this time I would like to be a Dentist. Why not?
