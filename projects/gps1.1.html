      <p>Pair programming is a collaboration environment where two people can work together on a single project. We're able to apply multiple perspectives and hopefully achieve a higher quality product.</p>
      <p>There are two roles in pair programming, driver and navigator. The driver listens to the navigator and tries to implement what he is saying. The navigator guides the driver to his vision for the goal/project.</p>
      <p>Pair programming is a very common practice among the workplace. DBC helps us familiarize ourselves not only with code, but prepare us for the real workworld.</p>
